Drag and Drop Application for Files:

This is simple Drag and Drop Application developed using MEAN Stack + Jquery. 
As storing of files or adding any entries to database was not needed during this assignment I have not used MongoDB from the MEAN Stack.

Jquery plugin used: https://github.com/danielm/uploader Thanks Daniel! For such a wonderful plugin :) 

I have integrated this Jquery plugin with Angular 6 for frontend and Express.js ( Node.js) as server for storing the files in the local folder.
